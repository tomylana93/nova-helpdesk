# Localization Rules (Laravel PHP Files Only)

## Allowed Localization Format
Use Laravel localization files:
- `lang/<locale>/*.php`

## Disallowed Format
Do not create or use:
- `lang/*.json`

## Key and Structure Consistency
Follow existing translation key patterns and file structure used by the project.
Keep additions grouped by domain and file responsibility.
