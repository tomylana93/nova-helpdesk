# Project Overview

- Name: `nova-helpdesk` (Laravel 12 + Inertia Vue starter-based app).
- Purpose: web helpdesk-style application scaffolded from Laravel Vue starter kit with authentication/profile settings and dashboard flows.
- Backend stack: PHP 8.5, Laravel 12, Inertia Laravel v2, Fortify, Wayfinder, Diglactic Laravel Breadcrumbs.
- Frontend stack: Vue 3 + TypeScript, Inertia Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, Reka UI/lucide.
- Testing stack: Pest 4 (Feature tests use RefreshDatabase), PHPUnit 12.
- Main route entrypoints:
    - `/` -> redirects to `/login`
    - `/dashboard` -> Inertia page `Dashboard` (auth + verified)
    - account/settings-related endpoints are at root paths: `/profile`, `/password`, `/two-factor`.
    - master module routes under `/master` with `master.*` names (`master.index`, `master.users.index`).
- `master.index` now renders Inertia page `master/Index` as a hub page with module cards configured from a local array (currently includes Users) linking to `/master/users`.
- Sidebar main navigation includes a `Master` item that links to `master.index`.
- High-level structure:
    - `app/` domain logic, controllers, models, actions.
    - `routes/` web/console routes (`settings` routes are consolidated in `routes/web.php`), plus breadcrumb definitions in `routes/breadcrumbs.php`.
  - Inertia shared props include backend-generated `breadcrumbs` used by `AppSidebarHeader` (no page-level hardcoded breadcrumb arrays).
    - `resources/js/` Inertia app: `pages`, `components`, `layouts`, `actions`, `routes`, `composables`.
    - `tests/Feature`, `tests/Unit`.
    - tooling config in `composer.json`, `package.json`, `pint.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`.
- Current module placement convention in this repo:
    - user listing table class is under `app/Tables/Master/UserTable.php` (`App\Tables\Master`).
    - user table resource is under `app/Http/Resources/Master/Users/UserTableResource.php` (`App\Http\Resources\Master\Users`).
- Master users CRU flow:
    - backend `UserController` uses FormRequest + Action pattern for `store` and `update`.
    - `UserController@edit` returns user payload via `App\Http\Resources\Master\Users\UserResource`.
    - reusable validation rules for users are centralized in `app/Concerns/UserValidationRules.php`.
    - frontend pages are `resources/js/pages/master/users/Index.vue`, `resources/js/pages/master/users/Create.vue`, and `resources/js/pages/master/users/Edit.vue`.
    - create/edit pages use the standard `ContentWrapper` form layout with shared `app.button.*` labels.
    - user primary key is UUID (`users.id` string) and session linkage uses `sessions.user_id` as UUID.
    - user edit/update controller routes use implicit model binding injection (`User $user`) with UUID primary key.
    - master users route uses Laravel helper `whereUuid('user')` for route parameter constraint.
    - wayfinder generated route params for `master/users/{user}` are now `string | number`, and current UI passes UUID string.
    - scope intentionally excludes `show` and `destroy` (resource route only `index/create/store/edit/update`).
    - create flow sets `status` to active in action (create form has no status field).
    - update flow allows `status` change, does not update password, and does not reset `email_verified_at`.
    - breadcrumbs include `master.users.create` and `master.users.edit`.
